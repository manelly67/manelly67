## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a CPA with over 30 years of experience and recently completed a full-stack development bootcamp in which I successfully built several projects using Javascript, React, Sql, Prisma and Nodejs.
<br>
My current focus is on combining my accounting skills with technology solutions: developing financial applications, automating accounting tasks and creating web tools for reporting, reconciliation and analysis.
